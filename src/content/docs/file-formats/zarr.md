## Overview

Zarr and OME-Zarr are modern, cloud-optimized storage formats that have become increasingly important for scientific imaging. Fileglancer provides specialized support for these formats, making them easy to browse, share, and convert.

## Understanding Zarr Format

### What is Zarr?

Zarr is a format for storing chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays. It's designed for:

- **Cloud-native storage**: Optimized for cloud and distributed file systems
- **Parallel access**: Multiple processes can read/write simultaneously
- **Compression**: Built-in compression reduces storage requirements
- **Language agnostic**: Accessible from Python, R, JavaScript, and other languages
- **Flexible metadata**: Extensible metadata system for custom information

### Zarr Structure in Fileglancer

When browsing Zarr datasets in Fileglancer, you'll see:

#### Directory Structure
```
dataset.zarr/
├── .zarray          # Array metadata
├── .zattrs          # Custom attributes
├── 0.0.0            # Chunk files
├── 0.0.1
├── 0.1.0
└── ...              # Additional chunks
```

#### What Fileglancer Shows
- **Dataset dimensions**: Array shape and data type information
- **Chunk structure**: How the data is divided for processing
- **Compression details**: Compression algorithms and ratios used
- **Metadata**: Custom attributes and array properties
- **Storage statistics**: Total size and number of chunks

### Zarr Benefits for Scientific Imaging

1. **Scalability**: Handle datasets from megabytes to petabytes
2. **Performance**: Fast random access to any part of the dataset
3. **Interoperability**: Work with data from multiple programming languages
4. **Version control**: Support for versioned datasets
5. **Network efficiency**: Only download the data you need

## Understanding OME-Zarr Format

### What is OME-Zarr?

OME-Zarr extends the Zarr format specifically for biological imaging:

- **OME metadata**: Rich metadata following OME (Open Microscopy Environment) standards
- **Multi-scale pyramids**: Multiple resolution levels for efficient viewing
- **Biological context**: Spatial, temporal, and channel organization
- **Standardized structure**: Consistent organization across different microscopy platforms

### OME-Zarr Structure in Fileglancer

#### Hierarchical Organization
```
dataset.ome.zarr/
├── .zgroup              # Group metadata
├── .zattrs              # OME metadata
├── 0/                   # Resolution level 0 (highest)
│   ├── .zarray
│   └── chunks...
├── 1/                   # Resolution level 1
│   ├── .zarray
│   └── chunks...
└── ...                  # Additional resolution levels
```

#### OME Metadata Information
- **Pixel sizes**: Physical dimensions (micrometers per pixel)
- **Channel information**: Wavelengths, names, colors
- **Time series**: Temporal spacing and frame information
- **Spatial coordinates**: Stage positions and coordinate systems
- **Acquisition parameters**: Microscope settings and protocols

### OME-Zarr Benefits for Microscopy

1. **Standardized metadata**: Consistent information across different microscopy platforms
2. **Multi-resolution viewing**: Smooth zooming and panning in viewers
3. **Cloud optimization**: Efficient streaming for web-based viewers
4. **Tool compatibility**: Works with ImageJ, Napari, Neuroglancer, and other tools
5. **Publication ready**: Suitable for data sharing and publication

- **Data type**: Numerical precision (uint8, uint16, float32, etc.)
- **Total size**: Storage space used by the dataset
- **Compression ratio**: How much space compression saves
- **Data link controls**: Toggle sharing for the dataset

#### Metadata Tab (OME-Zarr)

- **Time information**: Frame intervals and acquisition timing
- **Spatial data**: Coordinate systems and transformations
- **Instrument details**: Microscope and acquisition settings

### Creating Data Links for Zarr

Zarr and OME-Zarr datasets have enhanced data link features:

1. **Optimized streaming**: Links support efficient partial data access
2. **Neuroglancer integration**: Compatible datasets open directly in Neuroglancer
3. **Multi-resolution support**: Links work with pyramid structures
4. **Metadata preservation**: Shared links include full OME metadata

### Conversion Options

Fileglancer supports conversions to and from Zarr formats:

#### Converting TO Zarr/OME-Zarr

- **Format optimization**: Convert between different Zarr compression schemes
- **Resolution selection**: Extract specific resolution levels

## Best Practices for Zarr Data

### Organizing Zarr Datasets

1. **Descriptive naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions
   ```
   experiment-2024-03-15_sample-A_condition-control.ome.zarr
   ```

2. **Directory structure**: Organize datasets logically
   ```
   project/
   ├── raw-data/
   │   ├── sample-001.ome.zarr
   │   └── sample-002.ome.zarr
   └── processed/
       ├── sample-001-denoised.ome.zarr
       └── sample-002-denoised.ome.zarr
   ```

3. **Metadata completeness**: Ensure all relevant metadata is included
   - Pixel sizes and units
   - Channel information
   - Acquisition parameters
   - Sample preparation details

### Performance Optimization

1. **Appropriate chunk sizes**: Choose chunk dimensions that match your access patterns
2. **Compression selection**: Use appropriate compression for your data type
3. **Resolution levels**: Create multi-resolution pyramids for large datasets
