### Toolbar

Located above the file list, the toolbar provides essential navigation and management controls:

**Navigation Controls**
- **Home button** (house icon): Quick access to your home directory on the file system
- **Navigate to path** (arrow icon): Direct path entry field
- **Copy path** (clipboard icon): Copy the path of the directory or file you're currently viewing

**Directory Management**
- **Refresh button** (circular arrow): Update directory contents to reflect any changes
- **Favorites star**: Save current directory as a favorite for quick access later
- **Create folder button**: Create new directories (when permissions allow)

**View and Display**
- **Hide/view dot files** (eye icon): Show/hide files and folder that start with "."
- **Locations panel toggle**: Show/hide the left-side Locations panel
- **Properties panel toggle**: Show/hide the right-side Properties Panel

### Properties Panel

Contextual information panel (right side):

- **Overview tab**: General information and data link controls
- **Permissions tab**: Access control and sharing information
- **Conversion tab**: File conversion request interface (for applicable formats)

### Locations panel

Navigation and organization panel (left side):

The file browser is optimized for working with modern scientific imaging formats like OME-Zarr and N5. When these formats are detected, Fileglancer provides specialized features:

**Automatic Metadata Display**
- **Format recognition**: Automatically identifies OME-Zarr, Zarr, and N5 datasets
- **Metadata tables**: Displays key metadata such as multiscale levels, axes, shape, and units
- **Thumbnail preview**: Shows a visual preview of the dataset when available

**Quick Viewer Integration**
- **One-click access**: Open datasets directly in compatible viewers like Neuroglancer, Vol-E, and Avivator
- **Viewer buttons**: Located below the thumbnail preview in the Properties Panel
- **Copy data URL**: Quick button to copy shareable data links

**Supported Formats**
- **OME-Zarr**: Full metadata support with OME-NGFF specification compliance
- **Zarr**: Standard Zarr arrays with metadata display
- **N5**: Cellmap-style N5 datasets with automatic metadata parsing

These specialized features make it easy to browse, preview, and share large imaging datasets without leaving the file browser interface. For more details on using data viewers, see the [Data Tools Integration](/features/data-tools/) guide.

## Browser Customization

### Display Options

Customize the browser interface:

- **Resize columns**: Drag the boundary between columns to resize

### Sorting and Filtering
Organize large datasets by:

- **Name**: Alphabetical sorting with natural number ordering
- **Type**: Group files by format or extension
- **Last Modified**: Most recent or oldest files first
- **Size**: Sort by file size (largest/smallest first)

## Troubleshooting Browser Issues

### Common Problems

**Slow directory loading**
- Check network connectivity to file systems
- Try accessing smaller subdirectories first
- Close unnecessary browser tabs to improve performance
- Contact IT if persistent on all directories

**Missing files or directories**
- Verify permissions for the directory
- Check if files have been moved or renamed
- Refresh the directory view
- Confirm you're connected to the correct file system

**Interface not responsive**
- Refresh the browser page
- Check if you're still authenticated
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache and cookies

**Panels not showing**
- Look for panel toggle buttons in toolbar
- Try clicking on files or directories to activate
- Check browser window size (panel may be collapsed)

The Fileglancer file browser provides a comprehensive interface that combines the familiarity of standard file browsing with the specialized needs of scientific imaging data.
