Fileglancer provides powerful data sharing capabilities designed specifically for scientific collaboration. The platform allows you to easily share imaging datasets with internal colleagues and collaborators.

## Understanding Data Sharing in Fileglancer

### Core Sharing Principles

1. **No data movement**: Files remain in their original locations
2. **Persistent links**: URLs remain valid while data link is enabled
3. **Revocable sharing**: Disable sharing for a given file or folder at any time

### Types of Data Sharing

#### Zarr and OME-Zarr Sharing
- Share individual Zarr or OME-Zarr datasets
- Integrated with visualization tools in Fileglancer

#### Directory-Level Sharing
- Share entire directories and their contents
- Collaborators can browse the full directory structure
- Use the data in visualization and analysis tools

## Creating Shareable Data Links

### Basic Sharing Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to your data**
Use any navigation method to reach the target directory. Ensure you have appropriate permissions to share the data.

2. **Enable sharing**
Open the Properties Panel. Use the Overview tab to toggle data link creation. Copy the generated shareable URL.

3. **Share with internal collaborators**
Send the URL via email or messaging. Collaborators must be on the Janelia internal network to view data
</Steps>

#### Automatic Data Link Creation
- Enable automatic data links to streamline the sharing process
- Reduce clicks by removing the confirmation dialog step

## Permission Management

### Understanding Access Controls

Fileglancer data links allow anyone with the link to view the data on Janelia's internal network:

#### Network Access
- **Internal network**: Full access from Janelia internal network
- **VPN access**: Remote access through Janelia VPN

#### Data Sensitivity
1. **Review data content**: Ensure shared data is appropriate for the intended audience
2. **Consider privacy**: Be aware of any privacy implications of shared data

#### Access Monitoring
1. **Regular reviews**: Periodically review active data links on the Data Links page
2. **Disable unused data links**: Remove links that are no longer needed

## Troubleshooting Sharing Issues

**Collaborators can't access shared data links**
- Verify data integrity at source location
- Check network connectivity requirements
- Confirm sharing is enabled at correct directory level

**Performance issues with shared data**
- Consider data format optimization
- Check network bandwidth limitations

Data sharing in Fileglancer enables powerful collaboration that can enhance your research productivity and impact.
