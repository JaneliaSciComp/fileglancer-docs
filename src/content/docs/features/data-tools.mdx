Fileglancer provides seamless integration with multiple data viewers, allowing you to open compatible datasets directly for visualization, analysis, and sharing. When viewing OME-Zarr or compatible scientific imaging data, Fileglancer automatically displays "Open with" options for appropriate viewers.

## Available Data Tools

### [Neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer)

A powerful web-based viewer for large-scale volumetric data, particularly suited for:

- **Large-scale imaging datasets**: Terabyte-scale brain imaging data
- **Multi-resolution data**: Pyramidal data structures for efficient viewing
- **Multi-modal datasets**: Combine different types of imaging data
- **Collaborative visualization**: Share interactive views with colleagues

### [Vol-E (Volume Explorer)](https://vol-e.allencell.org/)

Allen Cell Institute's volume viewer designed for cellular and subcellular imaging:

- **Cell biology focus**: Optimized for cellular imaging workflows
- **Interactive 3D rendering**: Real-time volume rendering capabilities
- **Multiple rendering modes**: Surface rendering, volume rendering, and cross-sections
- **Cellular structure visualization**: Specialized for organelles and cellular components

### [Avivator](https://avivator.gehlenborglab.org/)

A lightweight, web-based image viewer for OME-Zarr data:

- **Multi-channel support**: View and blend multiple imaging channels
- **Interactive visualization**: Pan, zoom, and navigate through datasets
- **Channel controls**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and visibility per channel
- **Responsive design**: Works well on different screen sizes and devices

### [OME-ZARR Validator](https://ome.github.io/ome-ngff-validator/)

A diagnostic tool for verifying OME-Zarr dataset compliance:

- **Format validation**: Verify OME-Zarr specification compliance
- **Metadata checking**: Ensure proper OME metadata structure
- **Error reporting**: Identify and report format issues
- **Quality assurance**: Validate datasets before sharing or publication

## Accessing Data Tools from Fileglancer

### Locating Tool Options

When you navigate to a compatible dataset (OME-Zarr or Zarr format):

<Steps>
1. **View the file/directory in Fileglancer**<br/>
Navigate to your OME-Zarr dataset directory. The dataset will be recognized automatically.

2. **Find the "Open with" section**<br/>
   Located in the file preview area, below the thumbnail preview of the dataset. These is a list of compatible viewers with their respective logos. There is also a button to copy the direct data link.
</Steps>

### Launching Viewers

<Steps>
1. **Click the desired viewer button**
Each viewer opens in a new browser tab once a data link is available.

2. **Share viewer URLs**
Copy the URL from the opened viewer tab. Share with internal collaborators. URLs remain valid as long as data links are active.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Tools

### Data Loading Issues

**Problem**: A tool opens but no data appears

- Verify data format compatibility
- Ensure data structure is correct
- Request conversion to compatible format

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow data loading

- Check data chunk sizes and compression
- Consider creating optimized versions for viewing
- Verify network connectivity and speed

### Sharing Issues

**Problem**: Shared URLs don't work for collaborators

- Check the data link is still active
- Ensure collaborators are on correct network

The data tool in Fileglancer provides a powerful platform for collaborative visualization and analysis of scientific imaging data.
