When you open the tutorial interface, you'll be presented with three tour options. Each tour focuses on a specific workflow in Fileglancer.

- **"Navigate to path" widget**: Quickly jump to a specific directory
- **Sidebar**: Accessing zones, file shares, and favorites

- **Properties panel**: Viewing file and folder information

For further information on navigation features, see the [Navigating Files](../../workflows/navigation/) workflow guide.

### 2. Data Links Tour

Discover how to create and share links to your data. This tour covers:

- **Creating data links from the Properties panel**: Using the toggle switch to enable sharing for any directory
- **Creating data links for OME-Zarr, Zarr, or Cellmap N5 images**: Opening viewers and creating shareable links for imaging data
- **Enabling automatic data links**: Streamlining the link creation process through enabling this preference

### 3. File Conversion Tour

## Taking Multiple Tours

At the end of any tour, you have two options:

- **Take Another Tour**: Returns you to the tour selection dialog to choose a different tour
- **Exit Tour**: Closes the tutorial interface and returns you to your workflow

You can take the tours in any order and repeat them as many times as you'd like.

## Tips for Using the Tours

- **Follow along in real-time**: The tours guide you through actual features in the interface, so you can practice as you learn
- **Repeat as needed**: Revisit any tour when you need a refresher on a workflow
- **Explore after completion**: Once you finish a tour, try using the features on your own to reinforce what you learned
- **Consult the workflow guides**: Each tour corresponds to a detailed workflow guide for deeper understanding
