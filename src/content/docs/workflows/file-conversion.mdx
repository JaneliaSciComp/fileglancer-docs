Fileglancer integrates with Janelia's JIRA help desk system to handle manual data conversions. This feature allows you to request assistance converting your scientific imaging data between different formats.

## Supported Source Formats

Fileglancer conversion requests typically support:

- **Zarr arrays**: Existing Zarr datasets that need reformatting
- **OME-Zarr**: Conversion between OME-Zarr versions or structures
- **TIFF files**: TIFF data conversion to OME-Zarr format
- **OME-TIFF**: Metadata-rich TIFF conversions

## Requesting File Conversions

### Prerequisites

Before requesting a conversion:

**Verify source data accessibility**
   - Ensure you can navigate to and view the source data in Fileglancer
   - Confirm the data is complete and not corrupted
   - Check that you have read permissions for the source data

**Determine target format requirements**
   - Know what format you need for your analysis workflow
   - Understand any specific parameters or options required
   - Consider where the converted data should be stored

**Prepare conversion details**
   - Document any special requirements or constraints
   - Note any metadata that must be preserved

### Step-by-Step Conversion Request

#### For Zarr and OME-Zarr Data
<Steps>
1. **Navigate to your Zarr directory**<br/>
Use any navigation method to reach the Zarr or OME-Zarr directory. Ensure you're at the correct directory level containing the data.

2. **Open the Properties Panel**<br/>
Locate the Properties Panel on the right side. If not visible, look for the expand Properties button in the browser toolbar, on the right.

3. **Switch to the Conversion tab**<br/>
Click on the "Conversion" tab within the Properties Panel.<br/>

5. **Open the conversion request**<br/>
Click the button to "Open conversion request". This will open a dialog.

6. **Complete the dialog**<br/>
Fill out the dialog with required information.

7. **Submit your request**<br/>
Submit the dialog. View the information about the ticket now populated in the Properties panel.

## Tracking Your Conversion Requests

### Using the Tasks Page
<Steps>
1. **Navigate to the Tasks page**<br/>
Click on the Tasks page link at the top of the interface.<br/>

2. **View your requests**<br/>
See all current conversion requests and their status. Monitor progress through different conversion stages.
</Steps>

### Status Meanings

Understanding conversion request statuses:

- **Submitted**: Request received and queued for processing
- **In Review**: Technical staff reviewing the request details
- **In Progress**: Conversion actively being performed
- **Completed**: Conversion finished and data available
- **On Hold**: Waiting for additional information or clarification
- **Failed**: Conversion encountered errors (details provided)

### Accessing Converted Data
<Steps>
1. **Check completion notification**<br/>
Monitor the Tasks page for completion status. Look for email notifications as well.

2. **Locate converted data**<br/>
Navigate to the specified output directory. Verify the converted data is accessible.

3. **Validate conversion results**<br/>
Check that the converted data opens properly in your analysis tools. Verify metadata preservation. Compare file sizes and structure as expected.
</Steps>
## Troubleshooting Conversion Issues

### Common Request Problems

**Problem**: Conversion request form won't submit
- Solution: Check that all required fields are completed
- Verify you're still authenticated to the system
- Try using a different browser if issues persist

**Problem**: Can't find the Conversion tab
- Solution: Ensure you're navigating to Zarr or OME-Zarr directories
- Check that the Properties Panel is fully expanded
- Verify you have appropriate permissions for the directory

### Conversion Process Issues

**Problem**: Conversion failed or produced unexpected results
- Solution: Contact technical staff through the help desk system
- Provide specific details about what you expected vs. what occurred
- Include sample files or detailed error descriptions

**Problem**: Converted data is missing metadata
- Solution: Review your original conversion request for metadata requirements
- Contact technical staff to clarify metadata preservation options
- Consider requesting a re-conversion with specific metadata instructions

**Problem**: Conversion taking longer than expected
- Solution: Check the Tasks page for status updates
- Contact technical staff if no progress updates are visible
- Consider if the dataset size or complexity requires additional processing time
